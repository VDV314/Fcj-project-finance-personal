### General Evaluation

**1. Work Environment**  
The work environment is very friendly and open. FCJ team members are always ready to help when I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is neat and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think we could add more networking sessions or team bonding activities so everyone can understand each other better.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don't understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The team admin supports with procedures, documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work smoothly. I highly appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself rather than just providing answers.

**3. Alignment Between Work and Major**  
The work assigned to me aligns with the knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into new areas I had never encountered before. Thanks to this, I both reinforced my foundational knowledge and learned additional practical skills.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared many practical experiences that helped me better orient my career.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still maintains a pleasant atmosphere. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports each other regardless of position. This makes me feel like I'm part of the team, even though I'm just an intern.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**  
The company provides internship allowances and offers flexible time arrangements when necessary. Additionally, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a big plus.


### Additional Questions

**- What are you most satisfied with during your internship?**

What I am most satisfied with is **the dedicated support from my mentor and team**. My mentor not only provided detailed guidance but also encouraged me to think independently and solve problems, helping me develop independent thinking. Additionally, the **friendly work environment and mutual support culture** within the team made me feel welcomed and motivated to learn every day. Being able to participate in real projects and apply what I learned has been an extremely valuable experience.

**- What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**

I think the company could **organize more team meetings** to give interns opportunities to connect and understand each other better, especially when working remotely. Additionally, if possible, **establishing a clearer roadmap for interns** from the beginning - including goals to achieve and skills to develop - would help future interns orient themselves better and make the most of their internship time. Finally, **enhancing regular feedback sessions** (weekly or bi-weekly) would help interns know what they're doing well and what areas need improvement.

**- If introducing to friends, would you recommend them to intern here? Why?**

**Yes, I would absolutely recommend friends to intern here.** The main reasons are:
- **High-quality learning environment**: Working with experienced mentors, accessing technology and professional work processes
- **Positive company culture**: Everyone respects and supports each other, creating a comfortable atmosphere for interns
- **Work aligned with major**: Applying learned knowledge and developing practical skills
- **Personal development opportunities**: Not only learning technical skills but also practicing soft skills like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving

This is an ideal environment for those who want to accumulate practical experience and prepare for their future careers.


### Suggestions & Expectations

**- Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**

I have several suggestions to improve the internship experience:

1. **Organize more detailed orientation sessions**: Could organize comprehensive introduction sessions about company culture, work processes, and tools used in the first week to help interns get accustomed faster.

2. **Establish clear roadmap and objectives**: Build a specific timeline for skills to be acquired and projects to be completed in each phase, helping interns self-assess their progress.

3. **Enhance regular feedback sessions**: Could organize 1-on-1 meetings weekly or bi-weekly for mentors and interns to discuss progress, difficulties, and direction for upcoming work.

4. **Organize more team meeting activities**: Networking sessions, experience sharing among interns or with other teams to expand network and increase cohesion.

5. **Provide centralized learning materials**: Create a shared repository containing tutorial documents, best practices, and case studies for interns to self-learn and reference.

**- Would you like to continue this program in the future?**

**Yes, I would very much like to continue this internship program or similar programs in the future.**

The reasons are:
- **Professional learning environment**: I feel I have developed greatly in both technical skills and soft skills in a short time.
- **Excellent mentor and team**: The dedicated support and professional working style of the team are things I want to continue learning from.
- **Practical and meaningful work**: Participating in real projects helped me understand the industry better and accumulate valuable experience.
- **Suitable company culture**: The open culture and mutual support create motivation for me to commit long-term.

If given the opportunity, I hope to continue contributing and developing with the company, whether in part-time or full-time capacity.
